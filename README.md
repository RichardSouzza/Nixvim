## Keymaps

The definition of mappings tried as much as possible to follow a logic that was
not only easy to memorize and use, but also made sense.
Generally speaking, some common patterns are:

### Navigation
**Navigation between buffers:** `<A-S-Arrow>`

### Completion

**Select suggestions:** `<A-Left>` and `<A-Right>`
